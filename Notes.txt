Erase these as they are done

Use Bootstrap God Damnit.

Add nav bar to nav between tracks, title page, and connections to 
[Negativland Page(s), Kasem Wiki, U2 wiki, U2 Single wiki, original versions] at least;

Add mouse click controls to start, pause, and stop (and bump?) the track

Use one controler and upload sample bank from me, 
eventually being able to upload sample bank from soundboard?
This would allow different configurations of samples without creating a new board for each,
even allowing users to assign individual hotkey samples. There could be a few keys set aside to 
assign idividually.

Group alike samples together on the board(screen). 
i.e. All the casey's together, all the Billy and Jim's niece stuff together, noises, etc.
