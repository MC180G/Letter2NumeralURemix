This project started with the drum pad lesson from JS30 from Wes Bos. I basically replaced the sounds and text and increased the amount of buttons to include each keybord key.

I am using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS to create a "live" remix of a piece from a band who specializes in dropping sounds in seemingly at random. Drum pads are cool but live plunderphonics is Bos.

Future plans include the second track from the single. However, it does not lend itself as well to live remixing. Another plan involves users inputing their own "sound pack" and making their own original pieces. But the most ambitious of all the ideas for implymenting this is to actually compose original pieces designed to be mixed by the listener.
