    <h1>A Long Distance Dedication</h1>

    <p>
      The following is a semi-DIY remix of Negativland’s criminalized single U2.
    </p>

    <h2>Now, Let’s Go Back Into History A Little Bit</h2>

    <p>
      From 1980,
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negativland" target="_blank"
        >Negativland</a
      >
      has been <b>the</b> forefront of plunderphonics. They have plundered
      thrift store record bins, recorded their lives, and used their own radio
      presence to splice together soundscapes ranging from the thoughtful to the
      bizarre, overmined by a pervasive sense of humor. It’s art is at once
      familiar, frightening, fun, and compelling as one careens down rapids of
      commercials, interviews, and jingles, on original organic, electronic
      sounds and music.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a few critically lauded thought pieces and some live events, they
      received a copy of
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casey_Kasem" target="_blank"
        >Casey Kasem</a
      >
      freaking out at his producer over a tough transition from a pop song to a
      death dedication and also having reservations about some band called U2.
      This tape was better than Nucoa and they wanted to put it out for all to
      hear. Since the DJ was disparaging U2, the logical route was to use some
      U2 music, maybe doing a parody on something.
    </p>

    <p>
      1991 saw the release of Negativland’s single
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U2_(EP)" target="_blank">U2</a>, a
      parody cover of “I Still Haven’t Found What I’m Looking For” in their
      typical plunderphonic style. U2’s label, Island Records, chose to sue
      them, sledgehammering the type of underdog U2 stood for.
    </p>
    <p>
      Officially, their crimes were: Not clearing rights for the sample of the
      song; altering the lyrics, thereby voiding protection under Rights of
      Parody; Vulgar language; but most of all, the album cover, which
      deliberately distracted consumers awaiting the release of Achtung Baby,
      essentially “tricking” people into purchasing a piece they believe is by
      someone else. Negativland underestimated the ignorance of pop devotees and
      assumed people would figure it out immediately, whether or not they would
      appreciate it. However, when stores like Tower Records didn’t put any time
      into research or even reading the back of the album cover before setting
      up big window displays promoting “the new U2 single”, customers blindly
      trusted their music dealer.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Island Records were doing the drum banging, the four-man band 
      was barely aware of the case, but when interviewed by Negativland,
      The Edge said, “I think we would have reacted in a different way, but the
      lawsuit was not our lawsuit. Although we have some influence, we weren’t
      in a position to tell Island Records what to do.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Island Records damage was aimed mostly at SST Records for releasing the
      single, doing a lot of damage to a lot of good people not even involved.
      While the clash of Law and Justice is often made louder by money, in the end,
      Negativland did retain the rights to their own artwork. Unfortunately,
      this anhilated the Irish band from Dublin which has sentanced them into
      obscurity and no further information is available.
    </p>
    <p>
      The original piece is available on Seelard records along with other live
      pieces associated with the subject. Good luck getting it.

    <h2>“I I.D. This Show”</h2>
    <p>
      The great Kemal Amin “Casey” Kasem was not just a one-time
      <a href="https://youtu.be/PPUMCYg1gn8?t=1004" target="_blank"
        >Hitler impressionist</a
      >
      and the voice of American Top 40 for 29 non-consecutive years, but the
      seminal voice of Merry in the Bakshi LotR masterpiece The Return of the
      King, Batman’s decoy Robin, and, of course, Norville “Shaggy” Rodgers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Described as a “screamer” by his first wife, Kasem also used his voice and
      temper to champion underdogs all his life, from R&B in the early 60’s to
      Animal Rights in the 2000’s. Whether he was refusing to play Shaggy in a
      Burger King advertisement until he was portrayed vegetarian, stepping up
      for the rights of the homeless, or turning down the insensitive
      Transformers character Abdul from Carbombya (yes, Car-Bomb-Ya), Casey
      insisted people “use their fuckin’ brains”.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Mr. Kasem could not appreciate how he was used for the piece, he
      once again rose above the rhetoric to stand for his beliefs, refusing to
      participate in the case, publicly stating, “I don’t like what they did,
      it’s embarrassing to me, but I’m for free speech…”.
    </p>
    <p id="AP">
      “The Kasem tapes were an irresistible cult object because they captured
      the sound of a supposedly consummate pro losing his shit over something
      picayune, something the Internet would eventually render utterly
      unremarkable. But they also suggested that Kasem was human, and maybe even
      possessed personal taste. They belied his reputation as a yes-man for the
      monoculture in a way that made you like him more, not less.” - ALEX
      PAPPADEMAS – “A Goddamn Death Dedication” printed in Grantland, June 17,
      2014
    </p>

    <p>
      When “Casey” Kasem passed away on June 15th of 2014 following a grim and
      humiliating family dispute, Negativland decided to post the original
      master tracks to U2 in his honor. Fans are to use these tracks to remix
      the piece in any way and post it online.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have chosen to isolate these tracks and record a sort of Instrumental
      version for anyone and everyone to live mix over. I am looking in to
      recording options for later versions. Please enjoy and share the link.
